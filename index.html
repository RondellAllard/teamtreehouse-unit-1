        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring web developer. I have been teaching my self these
          skills for about a year with the time I had. I have been looking and
          have been failing to find a boot camp that could guide me along my
          journey, but due to my living in Trinidad, I have not had any luck.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently unemployed bartender due to the pandemic. Hoping to get back
          out there soon so I can afford the TechDegree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully I have come across teamtreehouse. This seems to be exactly
          what I need based on what I have seen thus far.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I aim to proficiently learn a full MERN stack along with some UX
          design, so that I may have the option of working as a freelancer and
          for companies.
        </p>
        <p>In that pursuit, I would seek to master these technologies:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Node JS</li>
          <li>Mongo DB</li>
          <li>Express</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would like to help local businesses achieve a strong online presence
          and eventually build my own business to improve my nation as a whole.
